Justin.tv Streaming Notifications
=============
This is an add-on for firefox, based on the Mozilla add-on SDK.

Description
=============
Knowing when your favorite justin.tv or twitch channels go live is hard. Most streamer notify their fan base via twitter. This add-on displays a notification when a streamer goes live.
The streams monitored can be set three different ways:
Automatically let the add-on search for your login name on justin.tv and twitch and displaying notifications for your favorites, displaying notifications for favorites of defined users or just notifications for channels defined in the options. The best thing: you can use all three features to define monitored channels at once.
The add-on gives you full control: you can even customize the interval of the add-on refreshing the state of the channels.

The notification shows the title of the stream and the channel name, as well as the channel's profile picture. A click on the notification focuses the tab with the channel page, if already opened, or opens a new tab to watch the stream.
